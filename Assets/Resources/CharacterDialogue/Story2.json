    "I'm so sorry that I made you drop your watch. It's all broken now.",
    "It's fine, don't worry. I'll mend it!",
    "But it won't be the same.",
    "It'll be better. Things that were broken and repaired are more beautiful. It's like, you cared enough to go to the trouble. It shows love.",
    "I wish my family realised that.",
    "Yeah, mine too. I never see Dad anymore.",
    "My mom calls me sometimes, but mostly she's glad to be away from us.",
    "That can’t be true. She must miss you.",
    "I'm really not sure.",
    "Well, I'd miss you.",
    "...",
    "Thanks, for all this. It feels good just talking to someone.",
    "For me too. It makes me feel like I can let go. Like I can breathe.",
    "When you're going to repair the watch, can I help you? Can we repair it together?",
    "You don't have to. I told you, I'm not angry.",
    "I know. But if the repair makes it more beautiful, I’d like to mend it with you."
