    "I can never thank you enough for coming with me.",
    "How are you feeling?",
    "The worst part was seeing Mom cry. I don’t think she regrets leaving Dad, or misses him. She just realises she'll always be lonely now. She'll never be able to mend things.",
    "We should make a pact. We should solemnly swear that we will never let each other be lonely. Come on! Let's hold hands and say the words.",
    "I don’t think so. We're not teenagers anymore, and it's raining...",
    "Who cares. This is your funeral suit now, you should just burn it when you get home. Give me your hand! There. Repeat after me. I, solemnly swear...",
    "I, solemnly swear... Wait, I'm pretty sure we used our names for this. Why can't I remember your name? Do you remember mine?.",
    "Player_Name, does it hurt? I miss you.",
    "I miss you too. Why can't I remember your name?"
